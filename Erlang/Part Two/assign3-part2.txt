A Ruby module provides a namespace and a mixin facility. Write a Ruby class that mixes in the built-in Comparable module. Include a string attribute. Implement the <=> method which returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the object is less than, equal to, or greater than the other object.  Implement this <=> method to compare based on the number of vowels in the string attribute. For example, "fruitcake" has four vowels. Show that you can compare objects of this class using the usual <, >, etc. operators.  Do not use <=> in your test code. Contrast this way of comparing with the usual string comparison to show the result is not always the same. As part of your testing include a sort of an array of your objects. (Array has a sort function).
